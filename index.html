            <!-- Unique aspects of California cliffs -->
            <h3>What is so unique about California cliffs?</h3>
            <p>
                California cliffs are one of a kind in the United States where no cliffs are as magnificent and
                beautiful as them. And California is the only state that has cliffs that front all possible
                environments: sea, river, mountains, and canyons. There are four such individual unique cliffs: West
                Cliff, North Cliff, East Cliff, and South Cliff. All offer fantastic overlooking views, recreational
                areas, camping sites, wildlife watch spots, and overnight cabins.
            </p>

            <!-- Location information about the cliffs -->
            <h3>Where are these cliffs?</h3>
            <p>
                Located within a 100-mile radius from Irvine, California, they can be reached by roads easily. The
                closest cliff to Irvine is West Cliff, which is the most popular and most visited.
